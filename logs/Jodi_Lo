tuesday 25 March 12:30-4:20 pm
	making a card
		how to make a window
		make a triangle
		color and shading
		make 12 triangles to make a cube
		change the location of the triangles to make a card
		make different colors and shading to have the card be seen in 3d
		learn about camera position
		change the camera position
		learn about depth of the object
		change the depth
		
	in the end i was able to render a card, based on my knowledge about how to
	make a triangle and then from there to make multiple triangles to form a cube.
	after that it wasn't necessary for me to learn how to do different coloring
	but it was easier to do so inorder to see the 3dness of the card (this i felt
	like took the longest honestly). i also learned about the camera position.
	changed that multiple times in order to make sure that the image was correct. 
	also learned about the depth prespetion to make sure that the object was seen
	correctly with the camera.
